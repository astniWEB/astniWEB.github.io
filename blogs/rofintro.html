                <p>Hey, so you might've heard of my new game, Remnants of Flesh, and you might be wondering what the hell that thing even is, so I made this blog to clarify that.</p>
                <p>First of all, I can't <span><i>really</i></span> say what it is since that would spoil some things probably, but I can go over the general idea of the gameplay.</p>
                <p>The game's open world, so you can explore around the city and talk to the people there, and they can give you stuff to do in exchange for money.</p>
                <p>It's also a top-down 2D pixel art game, as seen here.</p>
                <img src="../rofbirdass.png" alt="a screenshot of remnants of flesh" style="max-width: 95%;">
                <p>^^ You can also see it has a pretty grimy art style. ^^</p>
                <br>
                <p>My main inspiration for the game was a Game Boy Color game called Resident Evil Gaiden, which is my favorite GBC game, so it's basically a spiritual successor to it, just open world, and with a lot of new mechanics.</p>
                <img src="../regaidenscreenshot.jpg" alt="a screenshot of resident evil gaiden, specifically the battle system." width="350px" height="width" style="max-width: 80%;">
                <p>^^ The main thing i'm inspired by is the battle system. ^^</p>
                <p>Remnants' battle system is similar in how it works, but more complex, adding more items, a reload mechanic, dodging attacks, and quite a bit more.</p>

                <p>^^ The battle system currently looks like this, although the enemy sprite will probably be changed for an upgraaded one. ^^</p>
                <p>And without getting into too much spoilers (which is why I haven't discussed anything about the story), that's about it for the blog.</p>
                <p>You'll start seeing more of Remnants soon though, so stay tuned, and have a good day!</p>
