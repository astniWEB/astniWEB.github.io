                <p>We're back!</p>
                <p>It's been a while, since the website was working and stuff. (I think the website went down in April or May?)</p>
                <p>Either way, we're back, and with some new stuff.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As you might've noticed, there's:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 new blogs</li>
                    <li>1 new comic</li>
                    <li>Slight website redesign (we removed the header)</li>
                    <li>Added the steam page for Remnants on the sidebar</li>
                    <li>Updated the homepage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And you might be wondering what the comic was about considering I labeled it as a test comic.</p>
                <p>Rust & Harmony (R&H) is a comic series I'm gonna be making and it's just about some british guys that try to get by life.</p>
                <img src="../r&hgroupphoto.png" alt="a drawing of the comic's main characters" style="max-width: 95%;">
                <p>^^ Up here, a drawing of the main cast. ^^</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'll also try to make more blogs and comics in general for the site so it isn't too vacant. Maybe some more content that isn't either of those, idk.</p>
                <p>Anyways, I'll get going now, have a good day everyone! ^u^</p>
