                <hr>
                <p>Guess what? I remembered to make a blog!</p>
                <p>This is a short one since the content speaks for itself but hey, this section needs to be filled somehow.</p>
                <p>It's been a good few days of effort, writing and uploading stuff, but all my music's finally on the site, on YouTube, on Spotify, and up for grabs! (Except for the cover albums of course)</p>
                <p>Even the unreleased albums are here, like Metal Experiments! With a temporary page until it releases.</p>
                <p>I've shared some stories on how the albums were made on the album commentaries, and also the stories that the albums tell, so be sure to check them out!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyways that's about it for now, check out the music and have a good day.</p>
                <p>(By the way, if you're wondering where R&H is, it's on pause because I lost my pen charger and the new one arrives on the 22nd so I can't really work on it)</p>
