                <p>Welcome to astni.com! The most radical website ever created on the whole World Wide Web!</p>
                <p>Here you'll find... Huh we really don't have a lot right now.</p>
                <p>We're working on that though so don't worry, it won't be vacant forever!</p>

                <p>Hey!</p>
                <p>I'm Astni, I'm a videogame developer, composer, 2D/3D artist, YouTuber (occasionally) and subpar gamer.</p>
                <img src="astni.png" alt="a picture of astni (me), depicted in 3D" width="250px" height="width">
                <p>^^ Pictured here, me. ^^</p>
                <br>
                <p>I also have a <span><a href="https://discord.gg/ZbvSnTUnvK">Discord server</a></span> probably.</p>
                <p>I'm currently working on a game called Remnants of Flesh (Steam page in the sidebar), which is an open world, 2D top down survival horror game, set in a city that's falling apart due to an outbreak of nightmarish creatures, and their psycopathic followers.</p>
                <p>You can find some of my music on <span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1OoTCmuOOfHKoox4GVclLG">Spotify</a></span>, and I'm currently working on a new album there too!</p>
                <p>(YouTube videos are currently in a bit of a weird situation rn, so expect something maybe but also kinda don't.)</p>
                <p>When it comes to the website, I'll try to make more blogs and comics (more R&H coming out for sure, just gotta make that 1st comic), and if I do upload something else here, I'll be sure to notify you on my discord server!</p>
