                <h3>All events known so far:</h3>
                <p>On the afternoon of Febuary 3rd, 1980, 18 year old Fleck Reyes went missing, and at this time, most documentation relevant to the case has been lost.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At nighttime, on May 29th, 1988, the long-running Alkimax Laboratories (located at Oakley City, Michigan), explodes under mysterious circumstances.</p>
                <p>A man in an Alkimax Laboratories uniform, covered in blood showed up only 2 days later, police noticed him wandering around, and when he was talked to, the man pulled out a gun and told them to stay back.</p>
                <p>The man was then aprehended and brought to a psych ward, but all questions he was asked were only responded by silence, or by him quietly stating that he doesn't remember.</p>
                <p>Apart from the word "creature" scribbled all over his room, nothing much was found.</p>
                <p>After 3 years, he was let go and brought back into general population, and was provided with a therapist.</p>
                <br>
                <p>No one really agrees on the date, but in early November of 1993, reports of shapeshifting beings started spreading all around Oakley City, and that the city was essentially blocked off by destruction, and guarded by the aforementioned creatures.</p>
                <p>The events are still ongoing, but once we finish our investigation, more details will be posted on this site.</p>
                <p><a href="currentevents.html">Here is the soon to be complete page about the investigation.</a></p>
