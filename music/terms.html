                <h2 class="title">Music License for aStni's music (This is also the license included with any downloads):</h2>
                <p>The rules are simple so I will try to be as explicit as possible.</p>
                <b>You have full permission to do anything you want with these tracks, with the exception of:</b>
                <ul style="line-height: 150%;">
                    <li>Claiming the music was made by you or someone else.</li>
                    <li>Selling the music on it's own (burning the music on a CD, cassette tape, etc, is allowed, but selling those CDs, tapes, etc, MIGHT be prohibited, depends on the situation, just to be safe, be sure to <span><a href="../contact.html">contact me.</a></span>)</li>
                </ul>
                <b>And if you need clarification, here's the stuff you are allowed to do:</b>
                <ul style="line-height: 150%;">
                    <li>Use my music in any YouTube videos, YouTube streams, Twitch streams, and any kind of content you make, monetized or not. I will not take your money. (Unless you just straight up upload my music on it's own, but that should be clear already)</li>
                    <li>Use my music in any other creative project (film, videogame, etc), commercial or not. The only thing you can't do is sell my songs as part of a soundtrack.</li>
                    <li>Remix or cover my music. Depending on the case you may be allowed to commercialize the remix/cover but I'd rather you contact me with any of the stuff linked at <span><a href="../contact.html">https://www.astni.com/contact</a></span></li>
                    <li>Not credit me. If you don't want to or can't credit me, that is fine and you are allowed to do that with no problems, but I always appreciate credit. Nothing special, just say that music was made by aStni or something, do more if you want (like link my website/spotify/other socials) but you don't have to if you don't want to.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By the way if you need any instrumentals for the tracks (if they have any lyrics), modified versions of the tracks, isolated parts of some tracks, you can contact me and i will do my best to deliver.</p>
                <p>Also even if I go insane and some creature takes over my head and these terms are changed and I decide you aren't allowed to use these songs anymore, as long as you have this file (specifically the license included with the album downloads) you're safe and you're still fully allowed to use them.</p>
                <p>Aight, that should about cover everything but just in case:</p>
                <h3 class="title">TL;DR: Do whatever you want, as long as you don't sell my stuff* or claim it as your own</h3>
                <h4>Also, if an album does not include a download link, you are not allowed to use it. This applies only to the cover albums, since I do not have the rights to distribute them like that.</h4>
                <p>Thanks for reading all this (or skipping to the TL;DR, idc either way), I appreciate you being here!</p>
