                <h2 class="title">About the EP:</h2>
                <p>Metal Experiments is an EP that started in 2024 with just 4 songs, but after not being able to find a vocalist for the songs, I decided to release the work in progress instrumentals as an EP, and expand the EP into an album with 2 sides. (Which hasn't released yet at the time of writing this)</p>
                <p>The cover is different compared to the metal experiments album cover, this one is just a red lightning bolt with 5 cuts through it, referencing the 5 strings of a guitar.</p>
                <p>Amount of tracks: 4</p>
                <p>Overall genre: Metal</p>

                            this is one of 2 tracks that I made after i had the story in mind. quite a lot has changed about this one after the release, some of the instruments got switched, there's a new guitar part, it's slightly shortened, and the lyrics were completely rewritten. i wanted to give this one a kinda paranoid vibe, but with animalistic instincts coming through, which fits with the story.

                            this is also one that changed a lot after release, the instruments, the intensity, the lyrics, everything was bumped up to make it a better track because this version is just kinda alright. this is technically the oldest track since this is a remix of a track i made after analogus for another EP that fell through. the original one had a synth vibe to it still but it had some guitars, so i made it a lot heavier. the new version is definitely my favorite of the ME album's A side.

                            this was the first track that was made for the album (technically), and it's the one that's changed the least after release, just some slight tweaks to the instrumental and the lyrics. this one was inspired by metallica's for whom the bell tolls, so this one also had a war vibe before i even thought of the story. i wanted the sounds of war to really cut through the track, especially at the end, because the soldiers are losing their footing and they're diminishing in numbers, so i wanted it to sound desperate, and like the protagonist/listener is brave, but just a small part of this battle he cannot win.

                            this one also hasn't changed a lot. the lyrics were almost completely gutted in favor of just making it an instrumental track, and it got a new piano solo at the end, but aside from that just some new effects. this one was made when i was talking to one of my friends and they told me that they'd like to hear something like loading screen in the analogus album, so i made this as a bit of a palette cleanser for the album, while also making it fit with the story a bit. honestly one of my favorites.

                <h2 class="title">Story:</h2>
                <p>The story of the demo EP is the same as Metal Experiments' A side.</p>
                <p>A mad scientist starts kidnapping people off the streets, and morphs their bodies into blood hungry killing machines.</p>
                <p>After having built up an army, they escape the city and move to an abandoned church on a foggy hill, where they would set their mark and open the gates to hell on the church ontop of the hill.</p>
                <p>Metal Experiments is about the experiments themselves and how the humans slowly lose their will over time,</p>
                <p>A Foggy Hill is about the battle ontop of the hill in general, while Through The Lightning is just about one of the soldiers that perished in the battle,</p>
                <p>And Afterlife is just an instrumental that closes our curtain on the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The story was literally just based on this conversation i was having with one of my friends:</p>
