                <h2 class="title">About the album:</h2>
                <p>YHTRI24HBTOFB is an album that I released just to get something music related out there while Metal Experiments is cooking. It's an album with just unreleased tracks. It has almost no story.</p>
                <p>The album cover is just me asleep at my desk with music coming out of the computer, which was inspired by those lo-fi studying videos except I'm not that good at studying, I do a better job sleeping.</p>
                <p>Amount of tracks: 12</p>
                <p>Overall genre: Synthwave</p>

                            this is an old track called "into the stars", it originally had lyrics but i ain't dealing with that type of stuff anytime soon. most of the reason i even made this album was just so i could release this song as well as tracks 3 and 9. i like listening to this one quite a bit, it's special to me, this was right after my weird era of music where everything sounded horrible and i was going to give up on music entirely, but after sitting down and studying music theory, and after making quite a few bad tracks still, i came up with this one. analogus shaped my music style, metal experiments redefined it, but into the stars gave me hope.

                            this one was originally made right after into the stars, and it was right around that time that i started feeling comfortable with my music. i learnt the hard way that music is the art form that conveys feelings the hardest, so when i felt insecure about my music and just tried to throw something at the wall, the music would reflect my uncomftrable feelings towards it. so this is when i really started feeling good about it.

                            this is the last track i made for the album (technically), all the others were old tracks that got upgraded, but this one was made specifically for this album. i took inspiration from nine inch nails but with a slight horror twist. i also sampled my brother screaming at fortnite for the song. he was playing with his friends while i was making it and i could hear him from the other room so i just recorded the screams and put them into the song. definitely happy with this one despite industrial being a relatively new genre for my music.

                            this one was made right before demo1 (motherboard) and demo2 (machine with no ears) on the analogus album, and those tracks (along with the rest of analogus) started shaping my music style. not much i could do to this one except change the instruments.

                            this one spawned out of an idea i had randomly that became the first 30 seconds or so of the track, which i didn't really know how to expand, so i just threw it wherever it could go. but i'm happy i did that because i like the guitar part at the end that was caused by that cluelessness.

                            this is a relatively new synth track that i had when i was kinda tired of making music. this one was barely changed for this album, and honestly it's one of my least favorites. don't have a lot to say about this one, i just played a lot of ghostrunner 2 and wanted to make something similar to dan terminus' tracks for that game but it didn't go the best. definitely missing some variety.

                            this was made right after into the stars, before track 2, and they were going to go in the same album together, it was going to be called "music to fight aliens to", but was scrapped after i didn't know what else to make for the album and eventually got tired of it, and also because i didn't find a vocalist for into the stars.

                            the title is true, i don't like this one too much. this was an old track i had that i just wanted to release somehow, so i just made it the grandma's boss music, changed some instruments and called it a day. i don't really know how else to fix this one and i didn't really care either.

                            this one is definitely my favorite from the album, you can hear the old version on the youtube release and it's definitely improved a lot. the old one was one of my favorite unreleased tracks conceptually so i just wanted to make it the track it was destined to be.

                            this is also just an old lo-fi-ish track i had so i just added the right effects and slightly extended it. it's pretty aight but nothing special, but i like how it kinda has a cyclical feeling with the rest of the album, bringing it back to a more calm vibe.

                <p>The album has almost no story but there kinda is one. Although most songs take place in different universes so it'd be hard to put them in a single narrative.</p>
                <p>So honestly I'll leave the story up to you and if i like your version of the story, I can add it here!</p>
