                            this is one of the first good covers i made, probably back in 2022, just slightly tweaked. honestly one of my favorites to go back to, still pretty happy with it.

                            this is the only one with a custom video out of the EP, since i just had the idea for it and wanted to make it in blender. i just wanted to skip to my favorite part of the song and start from there, so that's why the start is at the end. honestly not that good of a cover, it's just aight.

                            not too bad but nothing special. with how good of a song this is i would've liked to make something better, but it's fine for what it is i guess. maybe some effects would've helped things. i do want to make more ace attorney covers though.

                            honestly one of my favorites from the EP, which is surprising considering it's action 52. this one wasn't too complicated either, the original was already pretty good so i just put my own spin on it.

                            say what you will about this game but the music kinda bangs. which is too bad because this is the worst cover in the EP. this is straight ass, i think i was just tired of making these covers.
