                <p>This EP is a collection of covers I've made in the past that was released just for fun (again).</p>
                <p>The cover was made in aseprite, and it was also just a rehash of a cover i had already made, just with the text changed.</p>
                <p>Amount of tracks: 5</p>
                <p>Overall genre: I really can't say for this one</p>

                            haven't played Quake II yet but i have played Quake Live, which includes Sonic Mayhem's soundtrack for Quake III Arena (alongside Front Line Assembly's part of the soundtrack of course), who also made the OST to Quake II, which slaps, and Quad Machine is my favorite of the tracks. not much i can say about the cover, it was pretty straightforward, but what i will say, is that 2 of the guitars i used were just MeowSynth with distortion applied.

                            this one was probably the most complicated to make (with the next 2 being kinda close), since i wanted to make a complete overhaul of the track to make it sound kinda EDM-ey, i used a lot of Serum, as well as keeping some of the original instruments intact. my favotite part of the track is the solo that goes before the guitar solo, and then also the guitar solo as well (which is like the entire middle portion of the track, but still).

                            same thing that applies to the last track applies here except i'm not being held at gunpoint this time (maybe). this one was actually pretty hard since it's a weird swing but not totally swing type of thing that made me feel like i was doing everything wrong but hey, it turned out alright in the end.

                            every year or so i make a cover of E1M1 but i was tired of E1M1 so i did this as a change of pace. i'm a pretty big fan, it's groovy.
