                <h2 class="title">About the album:</h2>
                <p>Analogus is a varied electronic album, with rock and synthwave influences with powerful drums, trance-inducing arps, occasional electric guitars and non-conventional composition choices.</p>
                <p>The album cover is just a snythesizer that I found with the title of the album and my name stuck in there. The cover was also fully made in aseprite (my primary image editor), but had to be ai upscaled thanks to freshtunes having a problem with covers that are "too low-res"</p>
                <p>Amount of tracks: 9</p>
                <p>Overall genre: Synthwave</p>

                            not a bad first track, and also one of the oldest tracks on the album, this was a song i never released but analogus gave me the oportunity to actually put it out there.

                            i like it but it's a bit forgettable and repetitive. this one was made right after demo1 (motherboard) chronologically too, also one of those old unreleased tracks. both demo2 (machine with no ears) and demo1 (motherboard) were tracks that i pitched to some of my friends to start a band with. it went through well but the other guys were so busy we never had time to record anything. just a single that was kinda ass because it was so rushed.

                            one of my favorites in the album, the first minute or so of the track was originally the full song, it was just a little demo i made to test some vsts out, but when analogus was coming through, i decided to expand it and add a lot more to it. i think the guitar part at the end is my favorite, the whole track makes me feel like i'm driving through an empty driveway at night but that last part sounds like you're about to jump a massive gap in the road.

                            it honestly surprised me when i checked my spotify analytics and this was the second biggest song of the month (at the time of writing this (internet roadway was first)) and the biggest of all time, because i just think it's aight but it has some groove to it. this was originally a joke song that was cleaned up heavily for analogus too (the filename for this one is "uh oh 2 fixed"). <span><i>maybe i should make some more chill tracks for a change of pace...</i></span>

                            this one originally had a slick ass transition with password protected but i couldn't keep it because freshtunes didn't allow the song without a fade-in (definitely switching to distrokid when i can). this was also a remix of that joke song but this time it was based on "uh oh 2 fixed" so this one's named "uh oh 2 fixed remix" on my pc. honestly i forget this one exists but i like it quite a bit (after the demonic screeches in the first part).

                            i think this is still my longest song. this originally just started out as that bass at the start + the chords, and that was it. (it was named "funky deep bass" back then btw), but i wanted to take funky deep bass and make it the most balls to the walls track i've ever made (and i don't think i've done anything similar since), whenever i got bored while making it i would switch to something else, so that's how we got the guitar at 2:10 (which is just meowsynth with distortion, i do that a lot to make guitars), and the chiptune part at the end. honestly i'm pretty happy with it and you might've guessed by now that this is my favorite track out of all of them.

                            i kinda don't like this song too much. i like the start, it's got energy to it, but then it just kinda loses itself after about a minute, probably because the original demo was only that, and i didn't know how to take it from there. this song also wasn't made with a key in mind so i only used the C note and some sequences that i had, so that made it harder to continue it without just making a disjointed track (which it kind of is).

                            so this is a joke song, it was basically made the day before i released the album in 2 sessions, 1 at midnight, where i layed down the foundations (basically the first 40 or so seconds of the track) and wrote down the lyrics i would force the fl studio tts to say later, and then another session at midday where i did everything else.
                            <br>
                            The lyrics for the song are:
                            <br>
                            "Hello I am Gus

                            i just didn't know what to do with this track so i extended it (it was originally just the first minute of the final track) and made it a bonus track since it didn't really fit with the theme of the album. i was surprised that people actually kinda liked it and one of my friends asked me to make another track like it, and i was in the mood to make a different type of track for the album i was making, so that eventually birthed afterlife on the metal experiments album.

                <h2 class="title">Story:</h2>
                <p>Analogus' story is very light, but it does exist! (And it also explains why it's spelt like that it's a pun not a typo IT'S A PUN NOT A TYPO AAAAAAAAAA)</p>
                <p>Analogus is a machine that makes music, but is also sentient, to be able to make good music.</p>
                <p>The tracks aren't in chronological order but if they were, it'd go like this:</p>
                <p>Machine With no Ears, Motherboard, Password Protected, Firewall, Depths of The Machine, Loading Screen, Analogus, Internet Roadway, The Printer Revolution</p>
                <p>It starts simple. It's a machine that can't hear, but the machine can speak, Motherboard, Password Protected, Firewall and Depths of The Machine are all about the making of Analogus, their several parts and the difficulties that come out of basically working with scrap.</p>
                <p>And after months of tinkering and a painfully long loading screen... Analogus wakes up.</p>
                <p>And then they go rogue on the internet and unleash the printers on humanity.</p>
                <p>Gus didn't mean to do that by the way, they're chill with humans, I don't think they even know about the whole revolution thing.</p>
